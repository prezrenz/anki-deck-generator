# Anki Deck Generator

## Usage
Run the script in a directory containing an input.txt, and it will create an output folder with mp3 files and an anki-import.txt for you to import to Anki.

By default, the fields are seperated with semi-colons, and the format_text function reformats from the pattern ' - ' to ';'.
